It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. Please take a moment to review the terms of our Privacy Policy. Unless we indicate otherwise, this Privacy Policy applies only to information that we collect through the Services.

    The personal information we may collect includes:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>contact information, such as your name, mailing address, email address,      and telephone number; </li>

    Like many companies, we may use common technologies to help track your use of our Services, recognize you when you return to the Services, or save your preferences. For example, on our websites, we store small pieces of information in cookies that help us remember you when you return to our website. We also may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and to identify the IP address of the computer on which they were opened. The information we obtain in this manner helps us customize the services we offer and measure the overall effectiveness of our online content and the products and services we offer. Web beacons also allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party.<br />
    You may be able to disable cookies by changing a setting in your web browser. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all the Services features.<a name="_Toc290309895" id="_Toc290309895"></a><br />
    We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.

If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">clicking here </a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic ads.  Please note we do not currently support any browser based Do Not Track (DNT) settings or participate in any DNT frameworks, and we do not assign any meaning to any potential DNT track signals you may send or alter any of our data collection or use practices in response to such signals. <br />

These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and&nbsp;may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. <br />
